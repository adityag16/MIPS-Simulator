# MIPS-Simulator

This is a C++ implementation of the MIPS 32 ISA as part of a project done in pairs for the Electronic and Information Engineering 2nd Year course at Imperial College London. The simulator is built according to the following specfication https://github.com/m8pple/arch2-2019-cw

To construct the simulator use command:
`make simulator`

To construct the test bench use command:
`make testbench`

To run the testbench against the simulator use commands:
`./bin/mips_testbench ./bin/mips_simulator`

Both the simulator and testbench were implemented from scracth without the use of the pre-exisitng skeleton code.
